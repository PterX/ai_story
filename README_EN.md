## 🚀 Quick Start

### Start with Docker Compose

Create a `compose.yml` file locally:

```yml
services:

  # Redis cache and message queue
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped

  # Django backend
  backend:
    image: xhongc/ai_story-backend
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./data/backend:/app/backend/data
      - ./storage:/app/storage
    environment:
      - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
    depends_on:
      - redis

  # Celery worker
  celery:
    image: xhongc/ai_story-backend
    working_dir: /app/backend
    command: celery -A config worker -l info -P gevent
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./data/backend:/app/backend/data
      - ./storage:/app/storage
    environment:
      - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.production
      - REDIS_HOST=redis
    depends_on:
      - redis

  # Vue frontend
  frontend:
    image: xhongc/ai_story-frontend
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

> **Note:** The Celery service must start in `/app/backend`; otherwise it will fail with `Unable to load celery application. The module config was not found.`

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Alternatively
docker compose up -d

# Create an administrator account
docker-compose exec backend python backend/manage.py createsuperuser
```

**Access:**
- Frontend application: http://localhost:3000

## Core Features

### 1. Intelligent Script Rewriting

Enter a story idea or outline, and AI automatically turns it into a complete script suitable for video.

**Highlights:**
- Multiple writing styles, including narrative, educational, and emotional
- Custom prompt templates
- Multiple AI models to choose from, including OpenAI and Claude
- Version history with comparison support

### 2. Automatic Storyboard Generation

Based on the rewritten script, AI automatically breaks the story into scenes and creates a detailed storyboard.

**Highlights:**
- Intelligent scene segmentation
- Automatic generation of visual descriptions and narration
- Professional image prompts for every shot
- Manual adjustment of shot order and content
- Configurable duration for each shot

### 3. AI Image Generation

Automatically call AI image-generation services to create high-quality images from storyboard prompts.

**Highlights:**
- Multiple image-generation platforms, including Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney
- Batch generation with real-time progress updates
- Automatic retries on failure
- Image preview and management
- Edit prompts and regenerate images

### 4. Intelligent Camera-Motion Planning

AI analyzes each scene and automatically creates an appropriate camera-motion plan.

**Highlights:**
- Multiple camera effects, including pans, tilts, push-ins, pull-outs, zooms, and static shots
- Intelligent matching of camera movements to scene content
- Customizable motion parameters, such as speed and intensity
- Preset library for camera movements

### 5. Image-to-Video Generation

Combine still images with camera-motion parameters to produce dynamic video clips.

**Highlights:**
- Multiple video-generation platforms, including Runway and Pika
- Customizable resolution and frame rate

- Save and reuse project templates

### 7. Prompt Management

A flexible prompt system that helps AI better understand your creative intent.

**Highlights:**
- Create and manage prompt collections
- Template variables, such as topic, style, and length
- Prompt version management
- Quality evaluation and optimization suggestions
- Prompt testing and preview

### 8. Model Configuration

Manage all AI services in one place and switch between them with ease.

**Highlights:**
- Support for multiple AI providers
- Multiple models configurable for each stage
- Load balancing through round-robin, random, weighted, and least-loaded strategies
- API connection testing
- Usage statistics and cost analysis
- Rate-limit configuration

## Inspiration

- My child refused to sleep after hearing the last story I made, so I quietly turned to this all-purpose bedtime-story library.

- I turned my child's doodles into a 10-page picture book. You only realize how useful this feature is after becoming a parent.

- I turned my cat into the lead of a palace-intrigue drama. I could not stop laughing.

- A beautifully shot micro-drama in five minutes. Who knew directing could be this accessible?

- For our anniversary, I gave my partner a novel about us. The result was spectacular.

- I fed one of my absurd dreams to AI, and it generated *Inception 2.0* for me.
